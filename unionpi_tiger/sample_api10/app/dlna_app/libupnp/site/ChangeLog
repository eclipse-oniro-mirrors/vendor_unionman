        Fix memory leak and ActionExAsync (#426)

        This intends to fix #424. I've found at least 2 memory leaks

        1- When sending Action(Ex)Async
        The ActionRequest document was not released nor was the ActionResult.
        I initially tought that this should be done in
        UpnpActionComplete::UpnpActionComplete_delete() but I was wrong because
        ActionRequest and ActionResult do not "belong" to the Evt object.
        The sets methods only set a pointer and modifying generator.c is not the
        right solution. The reason is that ActionRequest "belongs" to the ACTION
        job and should be handled as such if we want as well that, when the job
        is cancelled, the memory is released as well. So I've change the
        free_func for ACTION to reflect that.

        2- When using event subscription
        The Event was not released upon Timer termination. So I've done as
        above, created a special free_func that handles that properly.

        In general, when something prevents the execution/submission of a job,
        I've also used the actual free function instead of duplicating the
        individual free(). Note that when terminating a timer, I'm using the
        job's internal structure free_func() as it was already used to access
        arg. One can argue that it should be an opaque structure and get/set or
        the option to call the free function could be use instead.

        Also, I realized that ActionExAsync has never been working properly
        because when the job is executed, only an Action is made, never an
        ActionEx although the Header document is in the job's argument. I've
        fixed that as well and stopped there to not go too deep in that rabbit
        hole.

        I've also removed the upnp_timeout.c/h files as they were not used
        anymore (and had a strange names anyway)

        Handle redundant initialization

2022-12-22 Thoren Paulson <thoren.paulson@gmail.com>

        Clean up after failed initialization.

        Some initialization failures (such as failure in UpnpGetIfInfo) would
        leave resources like thread pools initialized. This change ensures if
        UpnpInit2 fails, we call UpnpFinish before returning to clean up those
        resources.

        To ensure UpnpFinish is effective in this way, we set UpnpSdkInit to 1
        earlier in UpnpInit2.

        This patch removes the templates and creates an auto generator for these

        Drop UpnpInit
	GitHub #182

        This function is deprecated since a long time moreover it is vulnerable
	to CallStranger a.k.a. CVE-2020-12695 and can't be fixed without
	breaking the API as HostIP only allows the user to pass an IP address
	and not a netmask.

        If we want to discover the netmask from the HostIP provided in UPnPInit,
	we'll have to loop through all the available interfaces to find the
	interface with the given IP address to finally retrieve the netmask.
	This is a lot of work/modification for a deprecated function. Moreover,
	in the end UPnPInit will be like a "deprecated" (i.e. IPv4-only) version
	of UPnPInit2.

        So it is time to remove this deprecated function.

        As a result, also remove getlocalhostname and DEFAULT_INTERFACE which
	are not needed anymore and replace UpnpInit by UpnpInit2 in comments.

        Partial fix for CallStranger on IPv4
	GitHub #181

        This is a partial fix for CallStranger a.k.a. CVE-2020-12695

        Check that DeliveryURLs are in the expected network segment as requested
	by the new UPnP UDA:
	https://openconnectivity.org/upnp-specs/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v2.0-20200417.pdf.

        Here is an extract of the new requirement:

        The subscription request containing a delivery URL not on the same
	network segment as the fully qualified event subscription URL shall not
	be accepted. For private networks this means that the delivery URL
	provided will adhere to the following IP ranges:

        . 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
	. 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
	. 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

        In the context of pupnp, this means that the IPv4 netmask is now
	retrieved when using UPnPInit2. Then, each DeliveryURL is checked
	against the device's IPv4 address and netmask. If one of them are not
	compliant, the whole subscription is rejected.

        This first commit should be enhanced / updated to:

        . remove UPnPInit (it is deprecated for a long time) or update it so
	. the user can also pass the netmask
	. fix IPv6
	. fix Windows code
	. retrieve the netmask in the BSD code of UPnPInit2

    Reduce spurious HTTP 416 errors due to ill-defined bytes header

    I (re)discovered this behavior trying to use the Gerbera media server
    with Chromecast (built in to my Vizio P55-F1 TV).  Chromecast specifies
    "bytes:0-" with no end range, which caused pupnp to return
    RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE.  Jin, the author of MediaTomb, of which Gerbera
    is a continuation, fixed this in 2007 in MediaTomb's fork of pupnp, see
    gerbera@ccd7994d45 "made sure that range requests specified as
    "bytes=0-" do not trigger...", but never passed the fix upstream.  When
    restarted as Gerbera, pupnp was removed from the local tree in favor of
    using the upstream version, and the patch was lost which lead to me
    rediscovering it recently.

    This is Jin's original patch applied to pupnp 1.8.  This teaches pupnp to
    ignore the bytes header if it matches "0-" and return HTTP_OK.

	If only the cookie argument was added, you could probably get away with
	this because all that would happen is that a garbage value is passed
	around without being used. With the addition of oldcookie, any old
	programs will not initialize this value and will probably segfault when
	libupnp tries to write to it.

	Fix large file system support

	libupnp uses large file support (if available). If a program linking to
	libupnp does not however it creates mismatches in call frames. See
	Issue #51 for the results.

	This simplifies LFS support by using AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE instead of
	manually defining _LARGE_FILE_SOURCE and _FILE_OFFSET_BITS (which is
	useless on architectures where the size of off_t is fixed).

	Furthermore additional logic is introduced to catch a library user without
	64 bit wide off_t on such a platform.

	upnp.h also makes use of off_t, but as this file includes FileInfo.h, the
	latter is the single right place for this check.

	This fixes #52 which is a generalized variant of #51.

	Queue events on their subscription object instead of adding them to the

	Events destined for a non-responding control point would flood the

	genaInitNotify()/genaInitNotifyExt() and

	There is a problem, perhaps, during downloading a document by
	UpnpDownloadXmlDoc. During debugging i've found that in an not exported
	api (unfortunately i forgot the code line...) where it is set a
	local variable "int timeout" to -1 then passed directly to another

	to 0 (there is an IF section that exits if timeout < 0). It is normal

	Refactor HTTP Client API to be more generic.

	The following features are added:

	- Support for persistent HTTP connections (reusing HTTP
	  connections). This is still a work in progress and relies on
	  applications to interpret the 'Connection' header
	  appropriately.

	- Support for specifying request headers when making
	  requests. Useful for interacting with web services that require

	- Support for retrieving response headers (this is a API only
	  change, some more work needs to be done to implement the actual
	  functionality. Specifically copy_msg_headers in httpreadwrite.c
	  needs to be implemented)

	- Common API for all HTTP methods.

	and returns immediately if it can not read or write on the socket. This
	is very useful for GENA notifications when pupnp is trying to send

	* SF Patch Tracker [ 2964685 ] patch for avoiding inet_ntoa (1.8.0)
	Submitted By: Nick Leverton (leveret)

	Seems like SF's tracker won't let me add a patch to someone else's issue ?!
	This refers to https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=2724578

	The calls to inet_ntoa are in getlocalhostname(), which is called from
	UpnpInit when it is returning the bound IP address.
	UpnpInit/getlocalhostname hasn't been updated to IPv6, I presume this is
	deliberate so that it doesn't start returning IPv6 addresses and
	overwriting the caller's IPv4-sized allocation.

	The attached patch just updates getlocalhostname to use inet_ntop instead
	of inet_ntoa, and also documents the fact that UpnpInit is IPv4 only whilst
	UpnpInnit2 is both IPv4 and IPv6.

	A fuller solution might be to change UpnpInit to use some variant on
	UpnpGetIfInfo. UpnpInit could still be left as IPv4 only if desired -
	perhaps UpnpGetIfInfo could take an option for the desired address family.
	getlocalhostname and its own copy of the interface scanning code would then
	be redundant. I don't have IPv6 capability here though so I'm reluctant to
	change the IPv6 code, as I have no way to test it.

	each time a device been added, UpnpInit() is called, on exit, UpnpFinish()
	is called, but the memories allocated by ThreadPoolInit() may lost because
	there's no code to call ThreadPoolShutdown() to release the memories. And
	inet_ntoa() is not thread safe, so in my patch, I substitute inet_ntoa()
	with inet_ntop().

	Since I'm working on an DLNA device the latter behavior is mandatory.

	I'm not sure if it would be ok for other device to have the charset
	field but it would help me a lot :)

	ixmlDocumentToString does not render the namespace tag.
	Submitted By: Beliveau - belivo

	The problem occurs when converting a xml document using

	ixmlDocument_createElementNS. The namespace tag doesn't get rendered.

	example: The following code fragment prints:

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<root></root>

	instead of:
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<root xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:device-1-0"></root>

	Code:

	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <upnp/ixml.h>

	int main()
	{
		IXML_Document* wDoc = ixmlDocument_createDocument();
		IXML_Element* wRoot = ixmlDocument_createElementNS(wDoc,
			"urn:schemas-upnp-org:device-1-0", "root");
		ixmlNode_appendChild((IXML_Node *)wDoc,(IXML_Node *)wRoot);
		DOMString wString = ixmlDocumentToString(wDoc);
		printf(wString);
		free(wString);
		ixmlDocument_free(wDoc);

		return 0;

	Replace MD5 implementation with public-domain version

	Currently the RSA MD5 implementation is used. Unfortunately the license
	has some potential issues:
	* The license does not explicitly allow distributing derivative works.
	This was the original argument used in
	[Debian #459516](https://bugs.debian.org/459516).
	* The license contains an advertising clause similar to the BSD 4-clause
	license. This is incompatible with the GPL and if it were enforced,
	would require RSA to be mentioned by pretty much everyone who uses pupnp.

	The simple solution is to replace it with a public domain
	implementation. I've taken OpenBSDs implementation and tweaked it
	slightly for use by pupnp by:
	- Adjusting the includes.
	- Removing the __bounded__ attributes which are specific to OpenBSD.
	- Using the standard integer types from stdint.h.
	- Using memset instead of explicit_bzero.

	SF Bugs #131, Creator: Jean-Francois Dockes

	I know it sounds crazy that nobody ever saw this, but the CONTENT-LENGTH
	value in GENA NOTIFY messages is too small by one.

	It appears that most current control points don't notice the extra
	character (an LF, which is validly there but not included in
	Content-Length), probably because their protocol handler is reasonably
	lenient, and because the missing body LF does not prevent parsing the
	XML. But there is a least one anal CP (Linn Kazoo) which barfs, because
	it reads all data until connection close and the size mismatch triggers
	a bug.

	"Proof":
	In gena_device.c:217 (notify_send_and_recv())

	ret_code = http_SendMessage(&info, &timeout,
	    "bbb",
	    start_msg.buf, start_msg.length,
	    propertySet, strlen(propertySet),
	    CRLF, strlen(CRLF));

	start_msg has all the headers, including the empty line.
	Content-length should be strlen(propertySet) + strlen(CRLF) (2)
	In gena_device.c:433 (AllocGenaHeaders())

	rc = snprintf(headers, headers_size, "%s%s%"PRIzu"%s%s%s",
	    HEADER_LINE_1,
	    HEADER_LINE_2A,

	    HEADER_LINE_2B,
	    HEADER_LINE_3,
	    HEADER_LINE_4);

	HEADER_LINE_2A is "CONTENT-LENGTH: ".
	The following value should be strlen(propertySet) + 2

	SF Patches #60, Creator: Jean-Francois Dockes

	When libupnp is configured with --enable-ipv6 but ipv6 is not available
	on the system (for example because the ipv6 code is not loaded in a Linux
	kernel as is the case by default on Raspbian), the ipv6 socket creation
	call will fail in miniserver.c and the library init will fail, even if
	the ipv4 initialization would have succeeded.

	Let a library configured with --enable-ipv6 initialize in ipv4-only
	mode if ipv6 is not available instead of failing. This can happen
	if no ipv6 code is configured or loaded in the kernel.

	Don't fail if IPv6 is unavailable.
	We might be an IPv6 enabled distro build running on an IPv4-only custom kernel.

	redefining strndup causes "error: expected identifier or '(' before '__extension__'"

	Fix redefinition of strnlen and strndup
	These are available when HAVE_STRNDUP and HAVE_STRNLEN are defined, but
	libupnp provides an extern prototype anyway.  Recent versions of glibc
	define this prototype differently, causing the following compile error:

	src/api/UpnpString.c:47:15: error: expected identifier or '(' before  '__extension__'
		extern char *strndup(__const char *__string, size_t __n);

	shutdown() on UDP sockets logs ENOTCONN message.
	https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/bugs/129/

	Fix ENOTCONN "Error in shutdown: Transport endpoint is not connected"

	When logging is enabled, ssdpserver logs bursts of
	"Error in shutdown: Transport endpoint is not connected"
	This is because shutdown() is not supported for UDP sockets and under
	recent UNIX specifications it returns ENOTCONN if used.

	SF Bug Tracker #127, Creator: Klaus Fischer
	Miniserver uses INADDR_ANY instead of HostIP
	https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/bugs/127/

	The internal miniserver.c uses INADDR_ANY instead of the HostIP/IfName
	provided when initializing libupnp. But, this HostIP/IfName gets used
	for the UDP socket when multicasting SSDP messages.  Because of this,
	miniserver may end up sending from different IP address than ssdpserver.
	This patch causes miniserver to use the already known interface address.

	Bug tracker #124 Build fails with --enable-debug

	Build environment
	Fedora 21

	* gcc 4.9.2

	How to repeat
	$ ./configure --enable debug

	^
	Makefile:1016: recipe for target 'src/api/libupnp_la-UpnpString.lo' failed

	Reason for failure
	Build enables -O2 optimization flags which causes the inclusion of a
	macro implementation of strndup from include/bits/string2.h.

	Workarounds
	Disable optimization when configuring or making:
	$ configure CFLAGS='-g -pthread -O0' --enable-debug
	$ make
	or
	$ configure --enable-debug
	$ make CFLAGS='-g -pthread -O0' Define NO_STRING_INLINES

	$ ./configure --enable-debug
	$ make

	Fix
	* Don't declare strndup in src/api/UpnpString.c if it exists

2015-02-01 Jean-Francois Dockes <medoc@users.sf.net>

	Out-of-tree builds seem to be currently broken, because ixml and
	threadutil files need an include path to include UpnpGlobal.h, and
	configure tries to copy files into a directory which it does not create.
	The patch fixes both issues.

	Access violation due to changed usage of pthreads-win32

	Dear libupnp developers,

	I have experienced a crash (access violation) when using libupnp on
	Windows. The crash is actually located in pthreads-win32 and happens
	when repeatedly de-/initializing libupnp on Win32 in the same process
	and both libupnp and pthreads-win32 are compiled as static libraries.

	So I'm doing this:
	- UpnpInit()
	- UpnpFinish()
	- UpnpInit() <- Crash

	I am already in touch with Ross Johnson on the pthreads-win32 mailing
	list regarding this issue:

	http://sourceware.org/ml/pthreads-win32/2013/msg00020.html

	He told me the problem is that the functions
	pthread_win32_process_attach/detach_np() should no longer be called
	directly, but are invoked automatically now since version 2.9.0 of
	pthreads-win32, which has been released approx. 1.5 years ago. Please
	refer to above link for in-depth information.

	So for proper using of latest pthreads-win32 library, those function
	calls should vanish inside libupnp. Could you consider adapting libupnp
	in that way? I would really like to use both libraries out-of-the-box
	without local modifications, and this issue prevents that.

	Best regards,
	Klaus

	tv_ctrlpt crashes after detecting a later version of tvcontrol service

	From:  gon3456@users.sf.net
	Steps to reproduce:
	1. Extracts and build libupnp-1.6.18
	$ tar -xjf /path/to/archive/libupnp-1.6.18.tar.bz2
	$ cd libupnp-1.6.18
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	2. Applies the attached patch and remake.
	$ patch -p1 < /path/to/patch/libupnp-1.6.18.patch
	$ make
	3. Run tv_device.
	$ cd upnp/sample
	$ ./tv_device
	4. Run tv_ctrlpt; the tv_ctrlpt crashes soon.
	$ ./tv_ctrlpt
	Segmentation fault (core dumped)
	This is an issue report about the sample program of control point.
	The tv_ctrlpt crashes after detecting a tvdevice that contains tvcontrol:2 or higher version of tvcontrol service.
	tv_ctrlpt should detect correctly such devices due to forward compatibility of control points with device.
	For more information about the compatibility, please refer the following document:
	DLNA Architectures and Protocols Part 1 2011 December - 7.3.2.1.3 (GUN:GZJXU)
	The attached patch changes the sample programs as below:
	- device: changes version of tvcontrol service from 1 to 2. This change may occur in the future.
	- cp: nothing changed: cp knows version 1 of tvcontrol service only.
	I know many vendors implements their control points based on the tv_ctrlpt, so I hope to fix this issue ASAP.

	==

	From: Yoichi NAKAYAMA
	SEGV is caused by strcpy with NULL argument.
	Attached patch will avoid SEGV in strcpy, but there may be other inconsistencies.

	> I know many vendors implements their control points based on the tv_ctrlpt,

	I don't think so. I think tv_ctrlpt is just a sample to be used with tv_device.

	Hi,

	I had found some bugs about memory leak on libupnp-1.6.18.

	It may lead to memory leak  when calling ThreadPoolAdd() or
	ThreadPoolAddPersistent() which does not return 0.

	See the attachment for patch.

	Suppose the UPnP device is listening on 192.168.1.102:49152. Use the following to send
	garbage bytes to the device:
	while true; do echo "\""; done | netcat 192.168.1.102 49152

	The device just keeps receiving these bytes and its memory usage keeps growing.
	Malicious client may exploit it to exhaust the device's memory.

	The attached patch eliminates this possibility.

	Patch to fix behavior when char is signed

	it seems to me that there is still something wrong:

	1)  the new is_qdtext_char() is incorrect.
	There is a trap if char is implemented as signed char.
	Suppose that c is '\xFF', it will be -1 when converted to an int.
	By definition, c should be qdtext:
	qdtext = <any TEXT except <">>
	TEXT = <any OCTET except CTLs, but including LWS>
	OCTET = <any 8-bit sequence of data>

	2) the character after '\\' could be either part of a quoted-pair
	(together with '\\'), or a normal qdtext, since '\\' itself can
	be treated as a qdtext. This is equivalent to saying that the
	character after '\\' in a quoted string could be ANY octet.

	A patch based on the above two observations is attached.

	Dear libupnp-devels,
	when POST'ing to the simple web server in libupnp, the application crashes.
	This is caused by a missing "..." argument in webserver.c:1533.
	Seems it has been there for a long time ... 1.6.9 and 1.6.18 have it.

	webserver.c:1533 calls http_MakeMessage
	/* Send response. */
	http_MakeMessage(&headers, 1, 1,
		 "RTLSXcCc",
		 ret, "text/html", X_USER_AGENT);
	The format parameter RTLSXcCc needs four arguments -
	R - response code - ret,
	T- content type - text/html,
	L - struct SendInstruction * - NOT PRESENT
	X - user agent - X_USER_AGENT

	This results in a crash.

	Changing to
	http_MakeMessage(&headers, 1, 1,
		 "RTLSXcCc",
		 ret, "text/html", &RespInstr, X_USER_AGENT);
	solves the situation.

	Yours,
	Sebastian Brandt
